Experimental programming language. I have been developing this to understand how interpreters and compilers work behind the scenes. P.S. ChatGPT has been used to help with the implementation.

## Examples:
Hello World
```
print("Hello World")
```

Assignment
```
a = 1 + 2
print("Value of a: {a}")
```

Functions
```
def add(x, y)
    x + y
def multiply(x, y)
    x * y
multiply(add(2, 3), 2)
```

If statement
```
a = 1 + 2
if a == 3
    print("Hello there!")
else
    print("Value of a: {a}")
```
